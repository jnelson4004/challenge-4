# <Javascript Quiz Challenge>

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a quiz mechanism, mostly utilizing JavaScript. Ideally this website would have had a timer, custom graphics, and other features; however, I did not remotely start to understand JavaScript until yesterday. I did successfully implement a basic quiz mechanism and a score counter.

## Installation

Unless something has gone wrong, this program should require no installation.

## Usage

Normal website usage.
